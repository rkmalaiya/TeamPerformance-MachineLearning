MAPREDUCE-5237. Add methods that were removed from ClusterStatus back into 2.x so as to be compatible with 1.x. Contributed by Zhijie Shen.
Incompatible as ClusterStatus.UNINITIALIZED_MEMORY_VALUE is a long now and so breaks 0.23.x but it shouldn't be a big deal in reality.

MAPREDUCE-4737. Ensure that mapreduce APIs are semantically consistent with mapred API w.r.t Mapper.cleanup and Reducer.cleanup; in the sense that cleanup is now called even if there is an error. The old mapred API already ensures that Mapper.close and Reducer.close are invoked during error handling. Note that it is an incompatible change, however end-users can override Mapper.run and Reducer.run to get the old (inconsistent) behaviour. Contributed by Arun C. Murthy.
